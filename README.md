## Problem

Running giveaways, contests, and sweepstakes manually can be time-consuming, prone to human error, and challenging to manage. Organizers often struggle with:

- Managing entries and ensuring fairness
- Tracking winners
- Keeping the process transparent and efficient

Participants, on the other hand, seek an easy, transparent, and fair way to enter giveaways and receive timely notifications about the status of their entries.

## Solution

Build a platform that allows users to:

1. **Create Giveaways**: Organizers can set up a giveaway by specifying details like prize, entry rules, eligibility criteria, and duration.
   
2. **Participate in Giveaways**: Users can enter giveaways by following simple rules such as following social media accounts, sharing posts, or answering questions.

3. **Automated Winner Selection**: The platform selects a winner automatically through random selection or based on specific criteria.

4. **Admin Panel**: Organizers have access to a dedicated panel to manage giveaways, view participants, and select winners.

5. **Transparency**: Participants can see if the giveaway has ended, and the winner is announced publicly. The automated winner selection ensures fairness.

6. **Notifications**: Participants are notified when they win or when a giveaway they entered concludes.

## Features

- **Social Media Integration**: Enable users to enter giveaways by logging in via social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook) or following social media pages.
- **Email Notifications**: Send emails to users for new giveaways, results, and reminders for prize claims.
- **Referral System**: Allow users to refer others and earn extra entries into giveaways.
- **User Verification**: Ensure that participants meet eligibility criteria before entering.
- **Admin Panel**: A user-friendly interface for organizing and managing giveaways.
- **Analytics**: Track engagement, the number of entries, and social media interactions to help organizers gauge the success of their giveaways.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Java (Spring Boot)**: For handling user authentication (JWT), giveaway creation, entry management, and winner selection.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  to store user data, giveaway details, entries, and winner selections.

### Frontend
- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface (entry forms, giveaway listings, winner announcements).

### Admin Panel
- A separate view for giveaway organizers to manage giveaways, view entries, and select winners.

### Additional Considerations
- **Security**: Use CAPTCHA and email verification to ensure the fairness of entries.
- **Scalability**: The platform can handle a growing number of users and giveaways over time.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality
- User sign-up and login (social media login options like Google and Facebook).
- Users can browse and participate in available giveaways.
- Automated winner selection after a giveaway ends.

### Phase 2: Admin Panel & Extra Features
- Organizers can create giveaways with customizable rules and prizes.
- Admins can either manually select winners or automate the process (random or based on specific actions).
- Notify participants about the giveaway results and prize claims.

### Phase 3: Additional Features & Polishing
- **Referral System**: Users earn extra entries for referring friends.
- **Leaderboard**: Display the most popular giveaways and the number of people who entered.
- **Social Media Integration**: Automate entries based on social media actions (e.g., following, tweeting).
- **Analytics**: Track engagement metrics, including shares and entries, via the admin panel.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Verification & Bot Prevention**: Implement additional security measures such as email verification and CAPTCHA to prevent bots and ensure the integrity of giveaways.
2. **Partnerships with Brands**: Once the platform is running, collaborate with brands to allow them to create their own giveaways, offering them analytics and marketing options.
3. **Prize Delivery System**: Add a feature that tracks the physical or digital delivery of prizes, improving the transparency and experience for participants.
